    "## 1. Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "After taking a university course in [cryptography](https://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=53&coid=264981) at McMaster University, I was inspired to create my own cryptosystem to challenge myself and understand the difficulty of creating a secure cryptosystem. This project explores the idea of incorporating two important concepts we learnt in lectures, the [CRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem) (Chinese Remainder Theorem), and [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_cryptosystem) (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption system. The CRT a concept in number theory that helps solve systems of congruences, which are multiple equations involving modular arithmetic. RSA is one of the oldest and widely known asymmetric cryptosystem based on principles from modular arithmetic and number theory, which relies on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. I will dive deeper into these concepts in the theoretical background section."

    "## 2. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal for this project is to integrate these two concepts to build a cryptosystem that demonstrates how modular arithmetic and number theory can be used for encryption and decryption. This system is an asymmetric cryptosystem, meaning it uses a pair of different keys; a public key to encrypt messages, and a private key to decrypt the message. The public key can be shared publicly while the private key must be kept secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that this cryptosystem is **NOT** secure,, so it is not recommended to encrypt highly important information with it, but it is a fun way to showcase how to encode and decode messages using different fundamental cryptography methods."

    "## 3. Theoretical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is intended for those who are unfamiliar with modular arithmetic and why it is important in cryptography. I will provide a brief overview of the key mathematical concepts used for this project, including modular arithmetic, the Chinese Remainder Theorem, and RSA cryptosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modular Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, which focuses on the remainder after being divided by a certian value called the **modulus**. Converting military 24 hour time into conventional 12 hour time uses the concept of modular arithmetic, where the modulus is 12. For example, 17:00 in military time is converted into 5:00. We are taking $17\\equiv 5 \\mod 12$, where we take 17 divided by 12, and getting a remainder of 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using modular arithmetic allows operations like modular exponents and modular inverses, which is capable of scrambling up big numbers easily but difficult to unscramble without knowing the numbers used to scramble. This concept is what makes modular arithmetic the backbone of cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "More about Modular Arithmetic can be read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic).\n",
    "\n",
    "### CRT - Chinese Remainder Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, CRT is a concept from number theory that helps solve system of congruences. These set of equations can look something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x \\equiv a_1 \\mod m_1$\n",
    "$x \\equiv a_2 \\mod m_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are co-prime, the CRT says that there is a unique solution for $x \\mod (m_1 \\times m_2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "CRT is an important concept in cryptography since it is often used to speed up computations for decryption. Instead of working work large numbers, we can break up the problem using CRT to work with smaller numbers, which take less computational power to compute. \n",
    "\n",
    "More about CRT can be read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### RSA - Rivest-Shamir-Adleman\n",
    "\n",
    "RSA is one of the earliest and well known asymmetric cryptosystem, that relies on the difficulty of factoring a product of two large prime numbers. In an RSA system, a public key is used to encrypt a message and a private key is used to decrypt the message. \n",
    "\n",

    "* Calculate œï(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1). \n",
    "* Choose e, which represents the public exponent such that e is coprime with œï(n) i.e. gcd(ùëí,(ùëù ‚àí 1)(ùëû ‚àí1)) = 1 to ensure that a modular inverse of e exists. Choosing a large e may be more secure, however it can make the encryption computation much slower, and choosing a small e may be vulnerable to attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The set of public keys are (p, q, e)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Encrytion steps\n",

    "# 6. Security\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the introduction this cryptosystem is not secure. Although there is a private key, all the information needed to calculate it is contained in the public key. Before we showcase how easily this system breaks down, we will talk about some potential security benefits. These benefits can be valuable especially when the attacker does not know the encryption and decryption algorithm. First, frequency analysis is not effective in trying to decode messages in this system. This is due to modular exponentiation to scramble the cipher takes unlike classical cyphers which can use letter frequencies to analyze systems \n",
    "and figure out certain letters. The system is also non-linear due to modular exponentiation which means that if a plaintext-cyphertext is known by an attacker it cannot easily be solved like other classical cyphers. Lastly, even if an attacker knows the encryption and decryption algorithm, if p and q are large enough the attacker would still need access to a device capable to compute large modular inverses as it is not feasible to solve on their own. So clearly a system like this is still more secure than a simple shift cypher but now we will show why it is still completely insecure.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the attacker knows the encryption and decryption algorithm and have access to a computer powerful enough to compute large modular inverses, then they can easily break down the cryptosystem. The key is that unlike RSA where p*q=N is the public key, here p and q are both in the public key which completely breaks the security of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1 Attack example\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say there is a public key (p, q, e) which are published, and an attacker interceps a message that is encoded with the public key ($C_1$, $C_2$) then the attacker has all the information they need. They can find the private keys $d_p \\equiv e^{-1} \\mod (p-1)$ $d_q \\equiv e^{e-1} \\mod (q-1)$ using p, q and e already known to the public to find $M_p \\equiv C_1^{d_p} \\mod p$ and $M_q \\equiv C_2^{d_q} \\mod q$. Once they find these values, they can set up the system of equations $M \\equiv M_p \\mod p$ and $M \\equiv M_q \\mod q$, where they can use the CRT to solve the system for M to obtain the original message. The key is the attacker knowing the decrpyiton algorithm which makes the rest of the attack easy as all the information needed is already known publicly.\n"
